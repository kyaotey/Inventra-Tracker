## 2. Sprint Planning & Execution

### 2.1 Sprint Duration
- **Length**: 2 weeks (10 working days)
- **Rationale**: Balance between responsiveness and stability
- **Exceptions**: First sprint may be 3 weeks for setup

### 2.2 Sprint Planning Meeting
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Participants**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team

#### Agenda:
1. **Sprint Goal Definition** (30 minutes)
   - Product Owner presents sprint objective
   - Team discusses feasibility and scope
   - Define "Definition of Done" for sprint

2. **Backlog Refinement** (45 minutes)
   - Review and estimate user stories
   - Break down complex stories
   - Clarify acceptance criteria

3. **Sprint Commitment** (45 minutes)
   - Team selects stories for sprint
   - Confirm capacity and availability
   - Finalize sprint backlog

### 2.3 Daily Standup Meeting
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Time**: 9:00 AM daily
**Format**: In-person or video conference

#### Three Questions:
1. **What did I accomplish yesterday?**
2. **What will I work on today?**
3. **What impediments are blocking me?**

#### Standup Rules:
- Keep it brief and focused
- Speak to the team, not the Scrum Master
- Update task status in project management tool
- Escalate blockers immediately after standup

## 3. User Story Management

### 3.1 User Story Template
```
As a [user type]
I want [feature/functionality]
So that [benefit/value]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Given [precondition]
- [ ] When [action]
- [ ] Then [expected result]

Definition of Done:
- [ ] Code written and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
```

### 3.2 Story Estimation
**Method**: Planning Poker (Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)

#### Estimation Guidelines:
- **1 point**: Simple bug fix or minor change
- **2-3 points**: Small feature, 1-2 days work
- **5 points**: Medium feature, 3-5 days work
- **8 points**: Large feature, 1-2 weeks work
- **13+ points**: Epic, needs breakdown

#### Estimation Process:
1. Product Owner presents story
2. Team asks clarifying questions
3. Each team member selects estimate card
4. Discuss differences if estimates vary widely
5. Re-estimate until consensus reached

### 3.3 Story Breakdown Guidelines
**Break down stories that are:**
- Larger than 8 story points
- Unclear or ambiguous
- Too complex to estimate accurately
- Dependent on multiple team members

**Breakdown Techniques:**
- **Workflow**: Break by user journey steps
- **Data**: Break by data entities
- **Interface**: Break by UI components
- **Business Rules**: Break by business logic

## 4. Product Backlog Management

#### Prioritization Criteria:
1. **Business Value**: Impact on user satisfaction
2. **Technical Risk**: Complexity and uncertainty
3. **Dependencies**: Blocking other features
4. **Effort**: Development time required
5. **User Impact**: Number of users affected
